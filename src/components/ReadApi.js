        context:"I am Ankit Soni, National General Secretary of Youth India Foundation. I started my journey in youth india in January 2021 as a business development member. It's been almost 7 months, and the graph of my learning experience has shown tremendous growth. With every passing day, not just on how to be a better worker or manager, but also, how to be a better person. Started in the field of public relations, marketing and business development, youth india has become the bedrock to my career. Nevertheless, it gives me the space to think and model my ideas as well as the opportunity to implement and see them in action. I believe that the potential of this foundation is beyond the seven skies and we, the youth in true sense, can make unbelievable changes, only if we believe in ourselves."

It is either a way to reassure themselves that they have a path worth walking or to experience control over their progress. This is what made me sign up with this organization whose workings I would describe as nothing short of quintessential. Haranguing about myself would be inconsequential, for I am nothing but a man here to help in the way I know best, IT and people. Help me make a change, no matter how small it is."
